Hi There,
Welcome once again to this folder.
Today at Holbeton we've kicked off with anew style of programming generally known as Object Oriented Programming(OOP). Let me hope you are abit familiar with th
is kind of programming and if you are not NEVER to worry,you got every thing at
hand.
In this directory you will find simple files including code defining the differe
nt concepts/terms and how they are benig used in OOP ie;
1. Classes
2. Instances/Objects
3. Fields/Variables
   * class variables
   * object variables
4. Methods/Functions
5. Data Abstraction
   * Encapsulation
   * Data Hiding
6. Data Security
   * public/protected/private
7. Gettors/accessors
8. Settors/mutators ..........etc
Cheers as you explore.
